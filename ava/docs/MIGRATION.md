# Migration Guide

This guide covers upgrading between releases of Asterisk AI Voice Agent.

## v7.6.1 to v7.6.2

v7.6.2 is an in-place feature and reliability release. It adds opt-in Gemini 3.8
Live, Microsoft Calendar invitations and same-call booking changes, shared Call
History filters, and Admin UI accessibility/readability improvements. There is
no database migration, dependency update, or change to saved Agent assignments,
selected providers, transport, Audio Profiles, or shipped Google Live model
defaults in this release.

Before upgrading, drain active calls and back up operator configuration, SQLite
data and calendar token caches using the [installation guide](INSTALLATION.md#upgrade-to-v762-existing-checkout).
Then:

1. Rebuild/recreate `ai_engine` and `admin_ui` together. The bundled
   `local_ai_server` is unchanged; do not start/recreate it solely for this
   release. Do not interrupt an active calendar booking conversation.
2. Preserve Microsoft account identities, OAuth caches, saved calendar IDs and
   Agent tool scopes. Verification reads the saved calendar directly and never
   chooses another/default calendar. A legacy `account_identity_mismatch`
   requires an operator to confirm the intended account and correct its
   configured identity to the cached MSAL username, not select a different user
   or reconnect as a workaround. Expired/revoked authorization still requires
   reconnecting.
3. Microsoft invitations remain disabled until explicitly enabled. Working
   hours guide suggestions; enforcing hours/days/horizon is a separate opt-in.
   Existing appointment-only create arguments remain supported. Review any
   integrations using arbitrary-ID deletion or private event bodies: mutations
   now require consent and tracked current-call ownership, and generic event
   reads omit invitation bodies. Later-call/untracked mutations require staff.
   Saved Agent prompts are not rewritten; calendar runtime guidance applies to
   full-agent and modular/hybrid providers. See the
   [calendar guide](Microsoft-calendar-tool.md#upgrading-existing-installations).
4. Gemini 3.8 Live is opt-in and Audio Only, with model-aware Vertex regions.
   Existing model defaults remain unchanged. Attached calls qualify the scoped
   Vertex `us-central1` paths, not every region, Developer API workload or
   provider/transport combination. Review the
   [Google](Provider-Google-Setup.md) and [Vertex](Provider-Vertex-Setup.md) guides
   before changing a production model.
5. Call History list, statistics and CSV/JSON exports now share all active
   filters. Multiple outcomes and **Only / Hide**, tool usage and duration
   filters are available; hiding outcomes retains calls with no outcome. A
   single `outcome` parameter remains compatible. No historical data is rewritten.
6. `farewell_hangup_delay_sec` is deprecated and ignored. Existing YAML values
   and the tools API remain accepted; its UI controls and shipped value are
   removed. Hangup still drains caller-facing audio, including the modular
   pipeline farewell fallback; Local AI's separate farewell controls remain.

Rollback requires no database downgrade. Drain calls and restore the v7.6.1
images/code and pre-update configuration backup, especially after adopting
Gemini 3.8-specific settings. Microsoft calendar IDs/caches need no conversion.
Existing Graph events and invitations remain: never delete appointments as
rollback cleanup. Same-call booking ownership is bounded/in-memory and cannot
survive a restart or code rollback; staff must handle untracked changes.
Invitation request success still does not establish delivery or acceptance, and
availability checks are not distributed exclusive reservations.

The maintainer confirmed the [#686 acceptance plan](Microsoft-calendar-tool.md#acceptance-plan-and-rollout)
was tested and validated for this release on 2026-10-02. See the
[v7.6.2 matrix](baselines/golden/v7.6.2-validation-matrix.md) for evidence and
qualification boundaries; this confirmation is not a blanket provider sweep.

## v7.6.0 to v7.6.1

v7.6.1 is an in-place feature, reliability, and security release. It adds the
opt-in Fish Audio modular TTS provider and realtime WebSocket streaming, improves
calendar result delivery and Google credential status, hardens attended-transfer
ownership and deferred-transfer audio drain, and updates `msgpack` to 1.2.1. It
does not migrate databases, reassign Agents, or change the selected provider,
transport, Audio Profile, or transfer destination on upgrade.

Before upgrading, drain or complete active calls and back up the normal operator
configuration and SQLite data. Then:

1. Rebuild and recreate `ai_engine` and `admin_ui`. The bundled
   `local_ai_server` is unchanged and does not need to be recreated for this
   release.
2. Existing providers and pipelines remain selected. Fish Audio is opt-in: add
   and test its provider-scoped API key, model, endpoint, and HTTP or realtime
   WebSocket transport before assigning it to an Agent or production pipeline.
3. Review deferred-transfer timing if the deployment has a custom policy. The
   transfer-specific drain ceiling now defaults to 15 seconds and fails closed:
   if caller-facing handoff audio cannot drain, AVA cancels the exact pending
   transfer and resumes the active AI voice instead of committing a truncated
   handoff.
4. For FreePBX pickup groups, confirm the pickup device still receives the
   configured screening prompt and must press the configured acceptance digit.
   AVA now transfers ownership to the pickup channel before the original ringing
   leg is destroyed.
5. Verify Google provider credential status and any Google or Microsoft Calendar
   tools used by the deployment. Calendar responses now preserve an allowlisted,
   bounded set of event and availability fields for every voice provider.

Rollback uses the v7.6.0 images and the pre-update configuration backup; there is
no database downgrade. Before rollback, drain calls and restore the v7.6.0
configuration backup, especially if Fish Audio providers, pipeline assignments,
or v7.6.1-only transfer controls were added. Older strict schemas may reject
unknown provider types or settings even when they are not selected.

## v7.5.6 to v7.6.0

v7.6.0 is an in-place minor release. It adds an opt-in Asterisk Media
WebSocket transport, bounded call metadata and call-local correction, and
privacy-safe call troubleshooting packages. It does not change the selected
transport, default Audio Profile, Agent assignment, provider credential, or
tool authorization on upgrade.

On first AI Engine startup, `call_history.db` receives three nullable text
columns: `call_metadata`, `call_metadata_updates`, and
`diagnostics_snapshot`. The migration is additive and automatic. Existing
rows remain valid with empty metadata and no settings snapshot; no `agents.db`
migration or manual SQL is required.

Before upgrading, drain or complete active calls and back up the normal
operator configuration and SQLite data. Then:

1. Rebuild and recreate `ai_engine` and `admin_ui`. Rebuild and recreate
   `local_ai_server` only when the deployment uses the bundled Local AI
   service; leave it absent or stopped on remote-only and split-server
   deployments.
2. Existing AudioSocket and ExternalMedia RTP installations continue using
   their saved transport. To opt into WebSocket, first qualify the exact
   Asterisk release, provider, codec, and topology; configure a source
   allowlist and normally authentication; add the matching per-call Asterisk
   WebSocket client; drain calls; then recreate the AI Engine. Only OpenAI
   Realtime with `ulaw` on Asterisk 22.10.1/FreePBX 17 has a live qualified
   smoke in this release. See [WebSocket Transport](WebSocket-Transport.md).
3. Call metadata persistence remains off until individual pre-call HTTP output
   fields are selected. Marking a field correctable defines the call-local
   schema but does not grant an Agent the `update_call_metadata` tool. Test the
   selected fields, exact Call History filters, exports, and post-call webhook
   data before relying on them operationally.
4. New calls capture an allowlisted effective-settings snapshot for
   troubleshooting. Historical calls remain usable but cannot reconstruct a
   snapshot that was never recorded. The legacy general log-export endpoint
   now returns a bounded, sanitized one-hour system package instead of an
   unbounded raw archive.
5. After the update, make controlled calls on every provider/transport pair
   the deployment intends to keep in service. Confirm greetings, two-way
   speech, interruption, applicable tools or transfers, intentional hangup,
   one terminal Call History record, and no orphan channels or media legs.
   Download a call package and verify it is useful without exposing caller
   identity, credentials, prompts, secret values, or recordings.

Rollback uses the prior tagged images and the pre-update configuration backup;
there is no database downgrade. The additive Call History columns may remain
and are ignored by older code. Before downgrading a WebSocket-enabled install,
drain calls, select and verify AudioSocket or ExternalMedia RTP, and restore a
configuration compatible with the prior release. In particular, remove or
reset WebSocket-only settings such as `control_format: auto/plain`, because
older strict schemas may reject them even when another transport is selected.

## v7.5.5 to v7.5.6

v7.5.6 is an in-place feature and reliability release with no database
migration, Agent reassignment, provider credential rewrite, or default Audio
Profile change. It changes outbound call setup, adds optional Agent hangup
policy fields, and adds optional configured-LLM fields to post-call webhooks.

Before upgrading, pause AAVA-managed outbound campaigns and back up the normal
operator configuration and SQLite data. Then:

1. Rebuild and recreate `admin_ui` and `ai_engine`. Rebuild and recreate
   `local_ai_server` in the same maintenance window only when this deployment
   uses the bundled Local AI service; leave it absent or stopped on remote-only
   and split-server deployments. Full Local calls with a non-default Agent
   hangup policy require a matching Local AI Server version; mixed versions
   fail call setup instead of silently discarding the override.
2. Existing Agents continue to inherit the global `hangup_call` markers. To
   opt in, configure an Agent's Hangup Guardrail to extend or replace those
   markers. Each new call captures its effective list; active calls do not
   change when the Agent is edited.
3. Existing post-call webhooks that generate summaries without a
   `summary_provider` retain the legacy `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `gpt-4o-mini`
   behavior. An explicitly selected modular LLM must be enabled and ready; a
   summary failure never falls back to another provider, while
   the webhook still runs with an empty `{summary}`.
4. If you use outbound lead `custom_vars`, keep the canonical serialized JSON
   at or below 8,192 bytes and exclude credentials. The engine now confirms
   the exact context after answer and before AMD; missing, corrupt, oversized,
   or unconfirmed nonempty context fails the attempt before an AI session
   starts.
5. Run a supervised outbound HUMAN call with a distinctive, non-sensitive
   context value and confirm the selected Agent receives it exactly. Also test
   each configured summary provider and each Agent hangup-policy strategy used
   in production before resuming traffic.

The originate-variable correction also restores the documented outbound
identity, routing, AudioSocket, predial-transfer, AMD, consent, and campaign
metadata sent through ARI's `variables` object. FreePBX operators should verify
the configured outbound identity, route, and caller ID after the upgrade.

Rollback uses the prior tagged images and the pre-update configuration backup;
there is no database downgrade. Pause campaigns before rollback so in-flight
calls stay on one engine version. Rollback now aborts before service changes
when the updater cannot verify the active-call count; restore AI Engine health
and retry. `AAVA_UPDATE_FORCE_ACTIVE_CALLS=true` is an emergency override that
may interrupt calls and must be used only after independently confirming that
continuation is safer than waiting. Restore the configuration backup as well
if you added v7.5.6-only Agent hangup or webhook summary settings.

## v7.5.4 to v7.5.5

v7.5.5 is an in-place feature release with no database migration, Agent
reassignment, provider credential change, or default Audio Profile change.

After upgrading:

1. Rebuild and recreate `admin_ui` and `ai_engine`.
2. If you use `check_extension_status`, review the new global "State Value
   Mapping" (Tools → Check Extension Status) and any per-extension
   "Availability Signals" you want to configure (Live Agents → advanced
   routing). Existing behavior is preserved by documented defaults; values
   not explicitly listed as Free or Busy are treated as not available
   (fail-closed) — confirm this matches your prior expectations if you relied
   on undocumented device-state values resolving to "available."
3. No action required for the collapsible sidebar or post-call webhook
   variable changes — both are additive and backward compatible.

Rollback uses the normal prior tagged images and the pre-update configuration
backup. There is no database downgrade step.

## v7.5.3 to v7.5.4

v7.5.4 is an in-place patch release with no database migration, Agent
reassignment, provider credential change, or default Audio Profile change.

After upgrading:

1. Rebuild and recreate `admin_ui` and `ai_engine`. The Admin UI recreation is
   required to install Docker SDK 7.1 and remove the false **Install Docker**
   guidance from v7.5.3. Recreate `local_ai_server` only when its image or local
   stack is intentionally part of the update.
2. Confirm `DIAG_ENABLE_TAPS=false` (and legacy `AAVA_AUDIO_DIAGNOSTICS` unset or
   false) for production. Disabled calls create no per-call diagnostic audio,
   but disabling diagnostics never deletes historical WAVs. The empty restricted
   `/tmp/ai-engine-captures` root may exist. Custom diagnostic roots must be owned
   by the engine user and cannot traverse unsafe writable or symlinked components.
3. Restart the AI Engine after changing `asterisk.ws_ping_interval_sec` or
   `asterisk.ws_ping_timeout_sec`. Both default to 10 seconds, producing a nominal
   20-second silent-failure detection bound before reconnect.
4. Review Deepgram Agent model, `agent_language`, and Aura voice selections.
   AAVA supports Flux English/Multilingual, Nova-3, and the legacy English
   Nova-2 Phone Call path across the documented seven-language Aura surface.
   Unknown or language-mismatched voices now fail before the provider session
   opens instead of silently falling back.
5. Preview updates that include Local AI. A missing and unselected service stays
   absent; a selected missing service may start; an installed stopped service is
   rebuilt image-only and stays stopped. Incomplete detection or
   `--rebuild=all` alone does not authorize creating or starting an absent Local
   AI service. Rollback preserves the stopped state.

The call-history redaction modes introduced since v7.5.3 affect only future
tool-result persistence. Existing redactions are not reversible and historical
rows are not rewritten.

Rollback uses the normal prior tagged images and the pre-update configuration
backup. There is no database downgrade step. Diagnostic artifacts written while
the opt-in was enabled must be removed separately according to the operator's
data-retention policy.

## v7.5.2 to v7.5.3

v7.5.3 is an in-place patch release with no database migration, Agent reassignment,
provider credential change, or default Audio Profile change.

After upgrading:

1. Rebuild and recreate `admin_ui` and `ai_engine`; recreate `local_ai_server` when
   using the bundled local stack so every service records the same release checkout.
2. Verify ARI, AudioSocket, enabled providers, configured pipelines, and local models
   are healthy before returning calls to service.
3. Use **Restore audio defaults** in an individual Provider, Audio Profile, or modular
   Pipeline editor when you need to remove stale audio overrides. Restore is deliberately
   scoped and does not change credentials, models, prompts, voices, Agent assignments,
   provider identity, or pipeline composition.
4. Existing transfer destinations require no migration. Queue, ring-group, and extension
   handoffs now report success only after a confirmed Asterisk continuation and retain
   ownership when the transport result is indeterminate.

Known UI-only issue: a clean Admin UI rebuild can show **Action Required** and
`Docker: --` because of the Docker SDK/Requests adapter mismatch tracked in
[#585](https://github.com/hkjarral/AVA-AI-Voice-Agent-for-Asterisk/issues/585).
If the Docker socket, containers, Compose, and AAVA health checks are working, do not
run the suggested **Install Docker** action.

Rollback is the normal tagged-release rollback. Restored audio values are ordinary
operator configuration changes; use the generated backup or restore the prior local
configuration if those values also need to be rolled back.

## v7.5.1 to v7.5.2

v7.5.2 is an in-place, backward-compatible audio release. It does not migrate
databases, rewrite Agent assignments, or change the default Audio Profile.
Existing Agents remain on their current 8 kHz behavior after upgrade.

After upgrading:

1. Rebuild and recreate `ai_engine`, `local_ai_server`, and `admin_ui` so the
   engine, Local protocol, and profile controls use the same release.
2. Verify the engine and Local AI health endpoints before returning calls to
   service.
3. Keep current PSTN/G.711 and ExternalMedia RTP Agents on
   `telephony_ulaw_8k` or `telephony_enhanced_8k`.
4. Opt in to `wideband_pcm_16k` only after confirming AudioSocket, a supported
   Asterisk version (20.17+, 21.12+, 22.7+, or 23.1+), and a caller leg that
   actually negotiates a wideband codec such as G.722.
5. Make a controlled test call and confirm the Transport Card reports
   `slin16@16000` before enabling additional Agents.

Rollback requires no database action: assign the Agent back to an 8 kHz Audio
Profile and apply the configuration. Local Kokoro can emit a truthful 16 kHz
contract, but CPU latency is hardware-dependent; Piper is the validated Local
TTS baseline for interactive calls.

## v7.5.0 to v7.5.1

v7.5.1 is an in-place hotfix with no database migration, audio-profile change,
or provider-default change. Follow the normal tagged-release update procedure
once the release is published.

After upgrading:

1. Recreate both `admin_ui` and `ai_engine` so the UI, API classification, and
   runtime reconciliation use the same v7.5.1 code.
2. Open **Tools & Capabilities**. Tool-only changes should show **Apply Changes**
   and hot reload into a new immutable tool generation; they should not request
   an AI Engine restart.
3. Open **System → Environment**, save a harmless environment edit, and apply it
   only when no calls are active. If replacement preparation or Compose fails,
   the UI reports whether the previous service stayed available or was restored.
4. Verify `ai_engine` health before returning the system to production traffic.

Managed-tool `DELETE /api/tools/managed/{name}` now returns HTTP 200 with the
deleted resource name and apply metadata instead of an empty HTTP 204 response.
Clients that accepted any 2xx response remain compatible; clients pinned to 204
must accept the structured 200 response.

The transcript fix applies only to future OpenAI Realtime and Grok calls. It
does not alter historical Call History records.

## v7.4.1 to v7.5.0

Released 2026-07-22. Follow the
[current upgrade procedure](INSTALLATION.md),
including the local-change decision, Compose validation, backup, and post-update checks.

### Audio transport and profiles

- Existing Agents keep their assigned Audio Profile. The established
  `telephony_ulaw_8k` profile retains compatibility downsampling behavior.
- `telephony_enhanced_8k` is opt-in. Assign it per Agent to use stateful,
  band-limited 16/24 kHz-to-8 kHz downsampling while preserving the existing
  8 kHz Asterisk wire contract.
- Hosted-provider and modular-pipeline output settings inherit the selected
  per-call Audio Profile unless an explicit narrower override is configured.
- Roll back the audio change by assigning the Agent back to
  `telephony_ulaw_8k`; no database or transport migration is required.

Review Agents after the upgrade and do not assume the enhanced profile was
assigned automatically.

The VICIdial integration now uses VICIdial's native Remote Agent lifecycle. VICIdial originates
and owns customer calls; AAVA supplies the mapped AI conversation and requests terminal actions
through the Agent and Non-Agent APIs.

This replaces the experimental direct-origination setup that used
`AAVA_OUTBOUND_PBX_TYPE=vicidial`, a VICIdial carrier context, and AAVA's own Call Scheduling
campaign engine. That legacy value remains readable for one migration release, is hidden from
new UI selection, and emits a startup warning. Do not rely on it beyond the next major release.

### Before upgrading

1. Back up `.env`, `data/operator/vicidial.db` if it already exists, the VICIdial database using
   VICIdial's supported backup procedure, and the relevant Asterisk/FreePBX configuration.
2. Record the existing VICIdial campaign, in-groups, statuses, carrier/DID routes, Remote Agent
   users, Phone extension, SIP/RTP topology, and server timezone.
3. Keep production carrier and DID routing under VICIdial. The new integration does not import,
   replace, or directly modify those objects.

### Migrate from direct origination

1. Upgrade and rebuild/recreate `ai_engine` and `admin_ui` together.
2. Create a dedicated least-privilege VICIdial API user and place its username/password in AAVA
   environment variables.
3. Create a dedicated VICIdial Phone, contiguous Remote Agent user range, and Remote Agent entry.
4. Create the AAVA-facing FreePBX trunk/registration and verify at least two registration and
   qualification cycles.
5. In **Call Scheduling → VICIdial Remote Agents**, create the connection and mapping, then apply
   the generated exact trusted dialplan context.
6. Reproduce only valid VICIdial statuses, DNC/callback policy, and cold-transfer destinations in
   the mapping allowlist. AAVA does not create missing production VICIdial statuses.
7. Run one-line outbound and any configured inbound acceptance calls before enabling additional
   lines. Verify VICIdial terminal records and Remote Agent return to `READY`, not only audio.
8. After the Remote Agent path passes, change `AAVA_OUTBOUND_PBX_TYPE` to `freepbx` or `generic`
   as appropriate and retire the old AAVA-native campaign that targeted VICIdial's carrier
   dialplan.

There is no automatic migration because the trusted SIP topology, VICIdial campaign ownership,
API permissions, statuses, and compliance policies require operator verification. See
[VICIdial Remote Agent Setup](Vicidial-Setup.md) for the complete setup and acceptance sequence.

## v7.3.x to v7.4.0

v7.4 removes Contexts as a product and runtime model. Agents in
`data/operator/agents.db` are the only persona/routing source after startup.

### Before upgrading

1. Follow the [current upgrade procedure](INSTALLATION.md),
   including the documented older-installation updater recovery path.
2. Back up `data/operator/agents.db`, `data/call_history.db`, `.env`, operator YAML,
   `config/users.json`, and any legacy `config/contexts/` files.
3. Record intentional tracked source changes and choose `retain`, `overwrite`, or
   `abort`; v7.4 will not choose silently.

### Contexts become Agents

- On first AI Engine startup, a lock-protected compatibility bridge reads the merged
  legacy Context configuration, validates the entire import, builds a temporary
  database, performs an integrity check, and atomically installs it only when the
  Agent store is empty.
- A populated `agents.db` is never reseeded or overwritten. Invalid legacy data blocks
  startup instead of producing a partial Agent set.
- `/contexts` shows a one-time retirement notice and redirects operators to **Agents**.
- `AI_CONTEXT` remains a deprecated display-name-first compatibility selector for old
  dialplans. Change new and maintained dialplans to `AI_AGENT=<agent-slug>`.
- Fresh installations receive Receptionist, Sales, and Support. Existing installations
  are not replaced with those defaults.
- The retired bundled `demo_project_expert` sample is excluded from migration so it
  cannot become a fresh installation's default Agent. Rename an intentionally customized
  copy before upgrading if it should be treated as operator configuration.

See [Operator Migration](OPERATOR_MIGRATION.md) for import, recovery, and rollback details.

### Tool inventory and Agent access

Transfer destinations, Google calendars, Microsoft accounts/calendars, and voicemail
destinations are configured globally under **Tools**. Access is then set on each Agent:

- **Inherit** exposes the applicable global inventory.
- **Allow selected** exposes only the selected resource keys.
- **Deny** exposes none of that tool family.

Legacy single-calendar/account and `tools.leave_voicemail.extension` configurations are
materialized as a compatible `default` resource. Review every Agent after migration,
especially Agents that previously used Context `tool_overrides`. A stale or empty allow
list fails closed; a globally disabled tool cannot be enabled by an Agent.

Tool names and Call History records are unchanged (`transfer_call`, calendar operations,
and `leave_voicemail`), so existing Call History filters and reports remain compatible.

### Save & Apply without restarting AI Engine

**Tools → Save & Apply** validates and publishes a new immutable tool generation for new
calls. Calls already in progress continue on their captured generation. If validation or
generation construction fails, the last good generation keeps running.

Provider, pipeline, VAD, streaming, environment/credential, Python-code, and MCP process
changes still require the restart/reload action shown by their own page. Tool inventory
reload does not imply those domains are hot-reloadable.

### Required post-upgrade checks

1. Confirm all expected Agents, prompts, providers/pipelines, and the default Agent.
2. Review Agent access for the four scoped tool families.
3. Save & Apply one harmless Tools edit and confirm the tool generation advances.
4. Place a test call for at least one hosted provider and verify allowed tool execution.
5. Confirm the call and canonical tool name appear in Call History.
6. Run `agent check` and inspect recent `ai_engine` and `admin_ui` logs.

## v7.3.1 to v7.3.2

v7.3.2 is a stabilization-only patch with no required schema migration and no
new provider additions. Existing provider keys, agent slugs, dialplan variables,
and transport settings remain compatible.

Notable upgrade behavior:

- Named Grok instances inherit the canonical `grok` voice, audio, and
  turn-detection settings before applying instance-specific credentials and
  metadata. Add an explicit value on the named instance only when it should
  intentionally differ from the canonical block.
- Grok caller-inactivity announcements use xAI `force_message`; no operator
  configuration change is required.
- `on_provider_failure: dialplan_redirect` is opt-in. Existing installations
  retain `announce_hangup` unless explicitly changed. Validate the redirect
  context/extension/priority on the target PBX before enabling it.
- Updater ownership, rollback, dirty-worktree handling, and validation retries
  are hardened without changing the normal `agent update` or Admin UI workflow.

Review the [v7.3.2 validation matrix](baselines/golden/v7.3.2-validation-matrix.md),
take backups, and deploy the published `v7.3.2` tag rather than an untagged
branch.

## v7.x to v7.2.0

**Fully back-compatible.** v7.2.0 is additive — no config, schema, or behavioral changes for existing deployments.

### What's new (opt-in)

- **Live-status hub** — the Admin UI dashboard now aggregates system component status via `/api/live-status` and `/api/live-status/stream` (SSE). No operator action required; the background probe loop starts automatically. Optionally set `LIVE_STATUS_PUSH_TOKEN` in `.env` to enable push updates from `ai_engine` and `local_ai_server` (see [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md#live-status-dashboard)).

### Upgrade

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v7.2.0
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate admin_ui
```

## v6.4.2 to v6.5.x

**Fully back-compatible.** v6.5.0, v6.5.1, v6.5.2, v6.5.3, and v6.5.4 are additive — no required config changes, no breaking schema changes, no behavioral changes for existing single-instance deployments. v6.5.2 does introduce one **breaking change for multi-instance deployments**: short provider aliases (`AI_PROVIDER=openai`, `AI_PROVIDER=google`, `provider: deepgram_agent`) are now rejected at config load — use exact provider instance keys instead. v6.5.3 is a **mandatory hotfix** for OpenAI Realtime users (OpenAI sunset the Beta API on 2026-05-12, so any deployment running v6.5.2 or earlier with OpenAI Realtime will fail until upgraded). v6.5.4 follows up by bringing all remaining code paths (Pydantic defaults, Admin UI templates, wizard backend, etc.) in line with the post-2026-05 GA reality — see "New in v6.5.4" below.

```bash
# Standard upgrade
git fetch --tags
git checkout v6.5.4
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate
```

New in v6.5.0 (opt-in):
- **Local LLM tool-gated response (#368)** — new WS message types `tool_context` / `tool_result` v2 used automatically when local LLM is the active backend; no config changes for existing deployments.
- **Deepgram Flux v2 + nova-3 default flip** — if you were relying on the implicit `nova-2` default in YAML, behavior is unchanged (the runtime hardcoded `nova-3` regardless of YAML before this flip). Only matters if you intentionally pinned `nova-2` in YAML.
- **Gemini 3.1 Flash Live** — verified compatible, no engine changes. Model picker now offers `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` alongside the existing `gemini-2.5-*` options.
- **HTTP-tool-test `.env`-first guard (#370)** — no migration; Admin UI Environment-page edits to `AAVA_HTTP_TOOL_TEST_*` now take effect without an `ai_engine` restart (was a bug, now fixed).

New in v6.5.1 (opt-in):
- **CPU-demo profile** — Faster-Whisper `tiny.en` + Piper + Qwen 0.5B is now selectable end-to-end via the Admin UI Models page. Pre-existing STT/TTS/LLM selections are unaffected.
- **New env vars (all default-safe)** — `FASTER_WHISPER_DEVICE` (default `cpu`), `FASTER_WHISPER_COMPUTE_TYPE` (default `int8`), `LOCAL_ENABLE_FILLER_AUDIO` (default `false`), `LOCAL_LLM_STREAMING_TTS_OVERLAP` (default `true`). See [ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md](ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md#local-ai-server-local-pipelines).
- **Runtime toggles** — Filler Audio and LLM/TTS Overlap can be flipped from the Models page without a model reload (filler-audio enable triggers a quick TTS pre-synthesis; disable clears the cache).
- **Local provider hot-path hardening** — internal change, no operator-visible config; if you observed audio glitching on `local_ai_server` reconnect events under v6.5.0, those should be fixed.

New in v6.5.2:
- **xAI Grok Voice Agent realtime provider (NEW)** — fifth full-agent realtime provider. Single-instance setup: set `XAI_API_KEY` in `.env` and add a `grok:` block to `config/ai-agent.yaml`. Multi-instance setup: create instances like `acme_grok` / `globex_grok` with `type: grok` and per-instance `api_key_file: /app/project/secrets/providers/<key>/api-key`. See [Provider-Grok-Setup.md](Provider-Grok-Setup.md) and [Multi-Instance-Full-Agent-Providers.md](Multi-Instance-Full-Agent-Providers.md). AAVA retains a conservative 28-minute warning from older xAI limits; xAI's current model page lists a 120-minute maximum session.
- **Multi-instance full-agent providers (NEW)** — operators can now configure multiple instances of the same full-agent provider type with isolated credentials (e.g. `acme_google_live` + `globex_google_live` both using `type: google_live`). Single-instance YAML (legacy `openai_realtime:` / `google_live:` / `deepgram:` / `elevenlabs:` / `grok:` block where the YAML key equals the kind) continues to work unchanged.
- **Per-instance credentials UX in Admin UI** — Add/Edit Provider modal exposes a uniform paste-style credentials uploader across all full-agent providers. Credential files are written under `/app/project/secrets/providers/<provider_key>/`. EnvPage adds a new "Per-Instance Provider Credentials" section that surfaces credential file presence per provider.
- **Browser playback for `.ulaw` recordings** — the Call Details modal now plays compact `.ulaw` recordings (and uppercase `.WAV`, compressed WAV, and `.gsm` via `sox`) in addition to PCM `.wav`. New env var `AAVA_RECORDING_TRANSCODE_TIMEOUT_SEC` (default `120`) for the `sox` transcode timeout.
- **Dashboard System Topology** — debounced indicators so transient probe blips don't flip dots red; ai_engine and local_ai_server probe timeouts bumped to 5s; provider cards grouped by type with multi-instance sub-rows; layout polish.
- **HelpTooltip backfill (~260 inline tooltips)** — provider forms, Setup Wizard, LLM/MCP/Profiles/Models pages all gain inline help. Tooltip popovers are viewport-aware and flip to render below the trigger when the icon is near the top of a scrolled modal.

**Breaking change in v6.5.2 (multi-instance deployments only):** Short provider aliases `AI_PROVIDER=openai`, `AI_PROVIDER=google`, and YAML `provider: deepgram_agent` are removed and now fail config validation instead of silently selecting an ambiguous provider when multiple provider instances exist.

| Old (rejected) | New (required) |
|---|---|
| `AI_PROVIDER=openai` | `AI_PROVIDER=openai_realtime` |
| `AI_PROVIDER=google` | `AI_PROVIDER=google_live` |
| `provider: deepgram_agent` | `provider: deepgram` |

Single-instance deployments using the canonical block names (`openai_realtime:` / `google_live:` / `deepgram:` / `elevenlabs:` / `grok:` where the YAML key equals the kind) are unaffected — only the short aliases are rejected. Audit your Asterisk dialplan `Set(AI_PROVIDER=…)` lines and any `contexts.<name>.provider:` YAML keys before upgrading.

No removed config options outside the alias removal above. No required schema migrations. No required Docker volume migrations.

New in v6.5.4 (OpenAI Realtime GA cleanup follow-up to v6.5.3):
- **Pydantic defaults** in `src/config.py` now default OpenAI Realtime to `api_version: ga` + `model: gpt-realtime`. Fresh wizard installs no longer create broken configs.
- **Admin UI "Add Provider" template** for OpenAI Realtime seeds GA defaults. The model dropdown removes the 5 sunset preview options and exposes 3 new GA models (`gpt-realtime-1.5`, `gpt-realtime-2`, `gpt-realtime-mini`).
- **Legacy preview values in operator YAML** render in a "Custom (legacy — will not connect)" optgroup with a yellow warning banner — operators can see at a glance which provider configs are broken by the OpenAI sunset, without us auto-rewriting their YAML.
- **Engine warning**: one-shot log line when `api_version: beta` is detected (gated by an instance flag so it fires exactly once per provider lifetime, not per reconnect attempt). This makes the cause of OpenAI's `beta_api_shape_disabled` rejection unambiguous in logs.
- **No new required action for operators**: if you already migrated per the v6.5.3 notes, v6.5.4 is a no-op for your running config. If you're still on a sunset preview model pinned in `ai-agent.local.yaml`, the Admin UI now shows you which provider is broken; switch the model to `gpt-realtime` (or another GA option) per `docs/Provider-OpenAI-Setup.md`.

New in v6.5.3 (hotfix — mandatory for OpenAI Realtime users):
- **OpenAI Realtime: GA API + `gpt-realtime` model are now the shipped defaults.** OpenAI sunset the Realtime Beta API on 2026-05-12 and removed `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17` on 2026-05-07. The shipped `config/ai-agent.yaml` previously pinned `api_version: beta` + that preview model; v6.5.3 flips them to `api_version: ga` + `model: gpt-realtime`.
- **Action required for operators with explicit overrides:** if your `config/ai-agent.local.yaml` (or any custom config) pins `api_version: beta` or `model: gpt-4o-realtime-preview-2024-12-17` (or any other `gpt-4o-realtime-preview-*` snapshot), **remove that override** or update it to GA — OpenAI returns `error.code: beta_api_shape_disabled` and closes the WebSocket otherwise.
- No code change. The provider's GA wire-protocol path has shipped since v6.0.0.

## v6.4.1 to v6.4.2

**Mostly back-compatible.** New features are additive or opt-in. A handful of
Google Calendar default-value changes affect operators who relied on the
previous backend defaults; explicit YAML configs are unchanged.

```bash
# Standard upgrade
git pull
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate
```

New in v6.4.2:
- **Microsoft Calendar V1 (NEW)** — Outlook / Microsoft 365 calendar integration via device-code OAuth. Opt-in: configure under `tools.microsoft_calendar.accounts.default` and bind to a context via `contexts.<name>.tool_overrides.microsoft_calendar.selected_accounts`. Setup guide: [docs/Microsoft-calendar-tool.md](Microsoft-calendar-tool.md).
- **Google Calendar — major overhaul**
  - Multi-account / per-context binding (#338): legacy single-calendar root fields still work as a fallback materialized as `calendars.default`. New nested shape: `tools.google_calendar.calendars.<key>.{credentials_path, calendar_id, timezone, subject?}`.
  - JSON upload + auto-discover from the Tools UI.
  - Domain-Wide Delegation support via optional `subject` per calendar.
  - Tools UI Verify with distinct error codes (`forbidden_calendar`, `calendar_not_found`, `auth_failed`, `dwd_not_configured`, etc.).
  - Native free/busy mode: blank/absent `free_prefix` switches to `freebusy.query()` intersected with a working-hours mask.
- **Reschedule reliability across all providers** — server-side `event_id` resolution + 400/404 fallback for both Google and Microsoft Calendar tools.
- **Date/time prompt placeholders** — `{today}`, `{current_date}`, `{current_weekday}`, `{current_time}`, `{current_datetime_iso}` resolved per-call inside `_apply_prompt_template_substitution`.
- **Google Live — full 30-voice catalog** in the Admin UI voice picker (#349).

Bug fixes that may change observable behavior:
- **OpenAI Realtime — duplicate events (3x) on fast tools** — fast tools no longer create duplicate calendar bookings. Race-condition fix between fast tool execution and `response.done` commit.
- **Per-context `tool_overrides` now actually take effect** on OpenAI Realtime, Deepgram, and Google Live (was silently ignored — only ElevenLabs honored it). If you have `selected_calendars`, custom transfer destinations, or webhook URLs configured per-context, they will now apply on the next call.

### Behavior changes operators should review

Google Calendar default-value changes — operators with explicit YAML keep their
existing values; those relying on backend defaults will see new behavior. Full
detail in [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) under *Migration notes
(calendar-improvements branch)*. Quick summary:

| Setting | Old default | New default | If you want old behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tools.google_calendar.min_slot_duration_minutes` | 15 | 30 | Set explicitly to `15` |
| `tools.google_calendar.max_slots_returned` | (unbounded) | 3 | Set to `0` to disable cap |
| `tools.google_calendar.max_event_duration_minutes` | (unbounded) | 240 | Set to `0` to disable cap |
| `tools.google_calendar.free_prefix` blank/absent | title-prefix mode (default `'Open'`) | native free/busy + working-hours mask | Set `free_prefix: 'Open'` (or any non-empty string) explicitly |

The slot-list message format and `create_event` success message have been
extended (extra timezone/duration/event_id guidance) but the legacy `"Free
slot starts:"` and `"Event created"` prefixes are preserved verbatim, so
prompt templates that pattern-match on those substrings keep working.

To stay on exact pre-PR behavior:

```yaml
tools:
  google_calendar:
    free_prefix: Open                  # keep title-prefix mode
    busy_prefix: Busy                  # keep busy-block scanning
    min_slot_duration_minutes: 15      # restore pre-6.4.2 slot grid
    max_slots_returned: 0              # disable slot cap (return all)
    max_event_duration_minutes: 0      # disable duration cap
```

## v6.4.0 to v6.4.1

**No breaking changes.** All new features are additive or opt-in.

```bash

- Live agent transfer tool (opt-in via tool allowlist)
- Experimental ViciDial outbound dialer configuration notes (opt-in via `.env`)

## v5.x to v6.0.0

### Breaking Changes

1. **OpenAI Realtime API version default changed to GA**
   - The default `api_version` is now `ga` (was `beta`)
   - GA uses nested audio schema (`audio.input.format` / `audio.output.format` with MIME types)
   - **To keep old behavior**: Set `api_version: beta` explicitly in your provider config

2. **Email template autoescaping enabled**
   - `template_renderer.py` now uses `autoescape=True` by default
   - Custom HTML templates that use raw HTML variables need Jinja2's `| safe` filter

### Upgrade Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup your configuration
cp .env .env.backup
cp config/ai-agent.yaml config/ai-agent.yaml.backup

# 2. Pull the latest code
git pull

# 3. Run preflight to update environment
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes

# 4. Rebuild and restart all containers
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate

# 5. Verify health
curl http://localhost:15000/health
agent check
```

If you were using `api_version: beta` explicitly, no OpenAI changes are needed. If you relied on the default, review your OpenAI provider config.

## v4.x to v6.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Config schema v4**: Milestone 13 migrated configuration format. Run `scripts/migrate_config_v4.py --dry-run` to preview changes, then `--apply` to migrate.
- **Diagnostic settings moved to `.env`**: Settings like `DIAG_EGRESS_SWAP_MODE`, `DIAG_ENABLE_TAPS`, and `STREAMING_LOG_LEVEL` are now environment variables, not YAML keys.
- **Prometheus/Grafana removed**: The monitoring stack is no longer shipped. Use Admin UI Call History for per-call debugging and bring your own Prometheus if needed.
- **Admin UI added**: Web interface on port 3003 for configuration and monitoring.
- **Multiple new providers**: Google Live, ElevenLabs Agent added since v4.x.
- **Tool calling system**: Unified tool framework with telephony and business tools.

### Upgrade Steps

```bash
# 1. Backup everything
cp -r config/ config.backup/
cp .env .env.backup

# 2. Pull the latest code
git pull

# 3. Run config migration (preview first)
python scripts/migrate_config_v4.py --dry-run
python scripts/migrate_config_v4.py --apply

# 4. Run preflight
sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes

# 5. Rebuild containers
docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate

# 6. Verify
agent check
curl http://localhost:15000/health
```

### Post-Migration

- Access Admin UI at `http://localhost:3003` (first-run password is printed to the admin_ui logs: `docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent logs admin_ui | grep -i password`; you'll be required to change it at first login)
- Review your provider configuration in the Admin UI Setup Wizard
- Check Call History for your first test call to verify everything works

## General Upgrade Procedure

For any version upgrade:

1. **Backup** your `.env`, `config/ai-agent.yaml`, and `config/ai-agent.local.yaml`
2. **Pull** the latest code: `git pull` (or use `agent update` which handles backup/restore automatically)
3. **Run preflight**: `sudo ./preflight.sh --apply-fixes`
4. **Rebuild**: `docker compose -p asterisk-ai-voice-agent up -d --build --force-recreate`
5. **Verify**: `agent check` and make a test call
